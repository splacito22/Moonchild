# 02 Moonchild, Advanced CSS: Portfolio

​

## Description

This project is a portfolio web application built from scratch using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this application is to showcase my developer skills, work samples, and provide contact information for potential employers.
​

​

## Tasks

Structure the HTML: Create the basic structure of the portfolio page

Apply CSS Styles: Style the portfolio page using CSS, focusing on layout, typography, colors, and visual elements. Utilize flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to create a responsive and visually appealing design.

Add Content: Populate the portfolio page with relevant content- name, profile picture, description in the "About" section, placeholder images and titles in the "Work" section, and a contact form in the "Contact" section.

Implement Navigation: Create a navigation menu with links that scroll to the corresponding sections of the page when clicked. Ensure that the navigation menu is responsive and functions properly on different screen sizes.

Create a Contact Form: Design and implement a contact form in the "Contact" section, allowing visitors to submit their name and email for further communication.

Test and Optimize: Test the portfolio web application on various devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and proper functionality.
